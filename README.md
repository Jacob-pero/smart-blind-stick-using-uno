# Smart Blind Stick using Arduino UNO

This project is a Smart Blind Stick designed to assist visually impaired people by detecting obstacles and alerting the user using a buzzer.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
- Buzzer to alert when an obstacle is nearby
- Lightweight and easy to carry
- Powered by Arduino UNO

## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Battery Pack

## How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to any object in front of the stick.  
If an obstacle is detected within a certain distance (for example, 50 cm), the buzzer sounds to alert the user.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jacob-pero/smart-blind-stick-using-uno.git
    ```
2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino UNO.
4. Upload the code.
